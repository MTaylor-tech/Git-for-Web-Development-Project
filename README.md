# Git for Web Development Project
In this project you will be using the concepts learned in the Git for Web Development lesson to fork/clone/push/and submit a PR for each project during this sprint.

This project consists of two parts:

## Part One:
You will need to follow the Lambda School Git Workflow to add a file to this project follow the steps below:

- [x] Create your own version of this repo - Fork
- [x] Add your TL as a collaborator
- [x] Clone this repo
- [x] Create a branch `git checkout -b 'firstName-lastName'`
  - [x] Add a file to the project called `yourFirstName-yourLastName`.txt. This should contain the link to your completed codepen from part 2 as well as the review questions/answers
  - [x] Run your usual git commands for adding/committing and pushing **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [ ] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  - [ ] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> master).
  - [ ] Add your TL as a reviewer on the Pull-Request
- [ ] TL then will count the Assignment as done by merging the HW back into master "STUDENT FORK".

## Part Two:
1. fork this codepen https://codepen.io/BritHemming/pen/eYYEoPa?editors=1100
2. You will be marking up all of the HTML and styling it to look like this: https://codepen.io/BritHemming/full/jONmxOm using CSS
* this should be review from yesterday/ extra practice
3. After you are finished please copy the review questions into your .txt file and answer them
4. don't forget to add, commit and push your changes.


## Stretch
Stretch Review questions:
    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
### Stretch Git Tasks
- [ ] While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independently research the following topics to learn more about Git.
  - [x] Research and understand what a `merge conflict` is and how to resolve it.
        **Done. This happens when merging branches that have incompatible commits, and you need to decide which changes to keep. It can sometimes be resolved using GitHub's conflict editor, though more serious conflicts must be resolved on a local clone of the repo.**
  - [x] Research the Git commands `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the master branch.
        **Done. `pull` gets the changes from the remote repository and adds them to the local store. `rebase` is used to move the main codebase to a parallel branch, then merge in all the changes that were made since that branch was made. `merge` combines the changes from two branches into one branch, typically used to bring changes from a daughter branch into the master branch.**
  - [ ] Research the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`. These commands will allow you to go back and amends previous commits you have made.
        **_Attempted._ I had a lot of trouble understanding these commands, but I'm going to keep searching for resources to help me learn them.**

- [x] Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console. **Done: GitHub Desktop**

- [x] Research and setup SSH keys with GitHub, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push. **Done**
